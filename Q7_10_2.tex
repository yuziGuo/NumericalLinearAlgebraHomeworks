\textcolor{blue}{[QR Factorization with MATLAB Householder]} 

(a) Write a Matlab function $[W,R] = house(A)$ that computes an implicit representation of a full QR factorization 
$A = QR$ of an $m \times n$ matrix $A$ with $m > n$ using Householder reflections. 
The output variables are a lower-triangular matrix $W \in \mathbb{C}^{m \times n}$ 
whose columns are the vectors $v_k$ defining the successive Householder reflections, 
and a triangular matrix $R \in \mathbb{C}^{n \times n}$.

(b) Write a Matlab function $Q = formQ(W)$ that takes 
the matrix $W$ produced by $house$ as input 
and generates a corresponding $m \times m$ orthogonal matrix $Q$.
